Hønsefuglportalen was launched in 2013 to coordinate local and regional tetraonid line transect survey initiatives. Through the project, it was ensured that common field protocols, analytical approaches and study designs were applied across study areas. Moreover, the program provide common e-infrastructure for data management and curation, and serve as a meeting point for further improvements of the line transect survey program as well as to provide a common meeting place for researchers and natural resource managers. 

<br/>

The main motivation for establishing the local and regional line transect survey programs was to obtain updated information about trends in abundance, in relation to natural resource management. In addition, data on other species observed along the transect lines, such as small rodents that are known to be strongly associated with grouse population fluctuations, have expanded the range of ecological questions that could be addressed with these data. The data from the program has formed the basis of a range of student theses and scientific papers.

<br/>

The program has been funded by several sources, following annual or multiyear contracts. In general, the landowners carries all the cost related to organization and actual performance of field work. In addition, the <a href="http://www.miljodirektoratet.no/en/" target="_blank" >Environmental Agency of Norway </a> have supported the work through a series of contracts to NINA since 2012. In addition, involved landowners are funding parts of the operating costs associated with running the infrastructure. Involved research institutions are using strategic funding to support the program.
